# Project Vridge

This is a voice synthesis application for verbally challenged individuals. It provides an opportunity for those who are challenged to pass their thoughts on others to engage in verbal conversations with others through the service.  This helps reduce inequalities in their communication.

## Problem Statement

Talking and communicating with family or friends is natural for most people, but this is not the case for people with speech impairments.

Rather than simply exchanging messages through text, communicating with sound through their own unique voices allows for more realistic and touching conversations by adding not only verbal expressions but also semi-verbal expressions.

Therefore, out of the 17 SDGs, we have selected the following two to address with our service.

**3. Good Health and Well-Being**

**10. Reduced Inequalities**

Through our application-based project, they can synthesize their own unique voice from their family’s voices and express the sentences with their own synthesized voice.
